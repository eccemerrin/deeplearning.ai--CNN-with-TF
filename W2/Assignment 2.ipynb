If your model didn't achieve these thresholds, try training again with a different model architecture, remember to use at least 3 convolutional layers or try tweaking the image augmentation process.\n\nYou might wonder why the training threshold to pass this assignment is significantly lower compared to last week's assignment. Image augmentation does help with overfitting but usually this comes at the expense of requiring more training time. To keep the training time reasonable, the same number of epochs as in the previous assignment are kept. \n\nHowever, as an optional exercise you are encouraged to try training for more epochs and to achieve really good training and validation accuracies.","metadata":{"id":"VGsaDMc-GMd4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#-----------------------------------------------------------\n# Retrieve a list of list results on training and test data\n# sets for each training epoch\n#-----------------------------------------------------------\nacc=history.history['accuracy']\nval_acc=history.history['val_accuracy']\nloss=history.history['loss']\nval_loss=history.history['val_loss']\n\nepochs=range(len(acc)) # Get number of epochs\n\n#------------------------------------------------\n# Plot training and validation accuracy per epoch\n#------------------------------------------------\nplt.plot(epochs, acc, 'r', \"Training Accuracy\")\nplt.plot(epochs, val_acc, 'b', \"Validation Accuracy\")\nplt.title('Training and validation accuracy')\nplt.show()\nprint(\"\")\n\n#------------------------------------------------\n# Plot training and validation loss per epoch\n#------------------------------------------------\nplt.plot(epochs, loss, 'r', \"Training Loss\")\nplt.plot(epochs, val_loss, 'b', \"Validation Loss\")\nplt.show()","metadata":{"id":"MWZrJN4-65RC","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-14T21:39:02.409376Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-14T21:39:02.410095Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-14T21:39:02.745356Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-14T21:39:02.410057Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-14T21:39:02.744374Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You will probably encounter that the model is overfitting, which means that it is doing a great job at classifying the images in the training set but struggles with new data.
